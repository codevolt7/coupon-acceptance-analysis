# coupon-acceptance-analysis : Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

This project explores consumer behavior based on various types of coupons offered during driving scenarios (e.g., Bar, Coffee House, Restaurant). The analysis focuses on identifying key features that influence whether a customer will accept a **Bar coupon**, and independently investigates characteristics of those who accept **other coupon types**.

## Key Findings

### Acceptance Patterns for Bar Coupons

- Drivers who **go to bars more than once a month**, are **not widowed**, and **donâ€™t travel with kids** are much more likely to accept bar coupons (~77.5% acceptance).
- Those who **frequently visit bars** and are **under 30** had a **100% acceptance rate**, though this group was small.
- Drivers who frequently go to **cheap restaurants** and earn **less than $50K** also had slightly higher acceptance (~37%) than the general population (~37%).

This suggests a strong social and lifestyle influenceâ€”bar coupon acceptance is highest among **young, socially active individuals** without dependents.
